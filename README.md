# Fellow
Front-end web GUI for the Fellow interview game!

### Before Starting
Make sure you have the server running so there is something to connect with.

Go to [fellow-core](https://github.com/alamorre/fellow-core) and follow the README.md file.

### Getting Started
Assuming fellow-core is up and running (locally) on http://127.0.0.1:8000, you can now start fellow.

```
git clone https://github.com/alamorre/fellow.git
cd fellow
yarn install
yarn start
```

you can expect the project to be running on http://localhost:8080 locally.

### Running Automation Tests
Once you have the project running, you can run the automation tests.

```
yarn test
```

Note: the tests only run on chrome driver.
