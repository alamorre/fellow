# Fellow
Front-end web GUI for the Fellow interview game!

### Before Starting
Make sure you have the server running so there is something to connect with.

Go to https://github.com/alamorre/fellow-core and follow README.md at the bottom.

### Getting Started
Assuming fellow-core is up and running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 locally, you can now run fellow.

```
git clone https://github.com/alamorre/fellow.git
cd fellow
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Running Automation Tests
This part should be done today...
