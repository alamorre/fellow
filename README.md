# Fellow
Front-end web GUI for the Fellow interview game!

### Before Starting
Make sure you have the server running so there is something to connect with.

Go to [fellow-core](https://github.com/alamorre/fellow-core)? and follow the README.md file.

### Getting Started
Assuming fellow-core is up and running (locally) on http://127.0.0.1:8000, you can now start fellow.

```
git clone https://github.com/alamorre/fellow.git
cd fellow
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Running Automation Tests
This part should be done today...
